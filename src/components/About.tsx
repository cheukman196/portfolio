            <p>I am a software engineer based in Toronto, Canada. I am experienced in back-end and full-stack development, 
                often taking projects from design to delivery. Currently attending George Brown College as a Computer Programming 
                and Analysis student. With three years of development experience, I have knowledge in developing full-scale web-apps, 
                lightweight desktop apps, online management tools and databases. 
                <br/>
                Bringing experience in software design and development, I am detail-oriented, goal-driven and thrive under pressure. 
                As an motivated learner and an excellent team player, I seek to provide the best solutions that align with the objectives of the organization.
